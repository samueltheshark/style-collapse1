   <span class="tab-text">Registered businesses add value-added tax (VAT) to their sales, known as output VAT, while VAT is charged on most goods and services they purchase, known as input VAT.</span>
   <span class="tab-text">There are three VAT rates:</span><br>
   <span class="tab-text-br">- the standard rate applies to most goods and services,<br>- the reduced rate applies to some goods and services, such as home energy, and<br>- the zero rate applies to most food and children's clothing.</span>
   <span class="tab-text">However, some supplies, such as postage stamps, financial, and insurance transactions, are exempt from VAT. A business must register for VAT if the value of taxable supplies exceeds the annual registration limit.</span>
